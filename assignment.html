 <dt><b>Disciplinary issues</b></dt>
 <dd>In October 2010, Shakib was on 92 in the fourth ODI against New Zealand, when there was movement near the sightscreen, which the umpires failed to stop.[179] After a few minutes Shakib, Bangladesh captain at the time, ran towards the sightscreen, hurled abuse and threatened to hit the offender with his bat.[179] He was later warned by the match referee.[179]

In March 2011, during the world cup match against West Indies, several people in the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium grandstand complained Shakib had reacted too strongly when he was booed.[179] The offending picture was spread over the internet and published in several newspapers. Within days of that incident, Shakib blasted former national cricketers in his Prothom Alo column.[179]

In February 2014, Shakib was fined BDT 300,000 and was handed with a three-ODI ban, because he had made an indecent gesture towards his crotch in the dressing room live on broadcast, during the second ODI against Sri Lanka.[180] Shakib later made a public apology statement through his official Facebook page.[181]</dd>
